Hello. I am a Turkish student named İsmail Emre Yılmaz. I live in Istanbul. I am interested in programming Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and C++ but i can't code at every one of them. 
I can code Python, HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. I am only confident at Python though. But programming isnt my only hobby. I am trying to learn Spanish, learn blender, 
do art, play the piano and trying to improve myself too. I know Turkish, English and a little Russian. I plan on learning Russian properly after i learn Spanish. I have big 
goals and i am planning on achieving them. The goal i am working on right now is making myself a website.

You can reach me at ismailemremreyilmaz@gmail.com
